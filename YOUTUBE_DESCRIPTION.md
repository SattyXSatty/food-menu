## Description

🍽️ **Tired of spending 10-15 minutes every day deciding what to cook?**

In this video, I build an intelligent AI-powered food menu suggester using a **multi-agent cognitive architecture** with **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** and **Gemini 2.0 Flash**.

### 🎯 The Problem
Every household faces this daily: "What should we cook for breakfast/lunch/dinner?" This simple question takes 10-15 minutes of thinking every single time!

### 💡 The Solution
An AI agent system that:
✅ Understands your preferences (taste, cooking style, ingredients)
✅ Considers time constraints (quick vs elaborate meals)
✅ Avoids repetition by checking meal history
✅ Generates complete, detailed North Indian menus
✅ Provides cooking times, difficulty levels, and chef's notes

### 🏗️ Architecture Highlights

**Multi-Agent Cognitive System:**
- **Perception Layer** - Extracts facts from user queries
- **Memory Layer** - Stores preferences and meal history
- **Decision Layer** - Orchestrates tool calls with full autonomy
- **Actions Layer** - MCP server with intelligent tools

**Key Features:**
🔧 **Proper MCP Implementation** - Actions run as MCP server with stdio communication
📊 **Pydantic Models** - Structured, validated data flow
🤖 **LLM-Driven Workflow** - Gemini decides which tools to call and when
🔄 **Feedback Loop** - Decision layer iterates until satisfied
🎨 **No Hardcoded Menus** - All dishes generated by LLM based on context

### 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Python 3.10+**
- **Gemini 2.0 Flash** (via google-generativeai)
- **MCP (Model Context Protocol)** with FastMCP
- **Pydantic** for data validation
- **Async/Await** for concurrent operations

### 📂 Project Structure
```
├── main.py          # Orchestrator with MCP client
├── perception.py    # Question generation & fact extraction
├── memory.py        # Preference storage
├── decision.py      # LLM-driven decision making
├── actions.py       # MCP server with tools
└── models.py        # Pydantic data models
```

### 🔧 MCP Tools
1. **check_calendar** - Get current date/day/time
2. **get_meal_history** - Retrieve recent meals
3. **get_user_preferences** - Get taste/style preferences
4. **generate_final_menu** - LLM-powered menu generation
5. **save_meal_to_history** - Store meal records
