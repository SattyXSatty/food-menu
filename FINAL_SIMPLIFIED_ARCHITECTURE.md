# Final Simplified Architecture

## Major Changes

Completely simplified the system by:
1. **Removed hardcoded dish databases** - No more predefined lists
2. **Removed prescribed workflow** - LLM decides everything
3. **Single menu generation tool** - Only `generate_final_menu` creates menus
4. **Full LLM autonomy** - LLM chooses which tools to call and when

## Tools (Simplified from 11 to 5)

### REMOVED Tools ‚ùå
- ~~get_dishes_by_meal_type~~ - Had hardcoded dish lists
- ~~get_side_dishes~~ - Had hardcoded side dishes
- ~~get_beverages~~ - Had hardcoded beverages
- ~~filter_dishes~~ - No longer needed
- ~~get_available_ingredients~~ - Not essential
- ~~get_dish_details~~ - Not needed

### KEPT Tools ‚úÖ

**1. check_calendar()**
- Gets current date, day, time
- Useful for context

**2. get_meal_history(days)**
- Retrieves recent meals
- Helps avoid repetition

**3. get_user_preferences()**
- Gets taste, food style, ingredients
- From stored preferences

**4. generate_final_menu(context_json)** ‚≠ê KEY TOOL
- **Uses Gemini LLM** to generate complete menu
- Takes all context as input
- Returns detailed menu with:
  - Main dishes with descriptions
  - Side dishes
  - Beverages
  - Cooking times
  - Difficulty levels
  - Chef's notes
- **NO hardcoded dishes** - LLM creates everything

**5. save_meal_to_history(meal_data_json)**
- Saves meal to history
- Optional tool

## Decision Layer - Full LLM Autonomy

### OLD Approach ‚ùå
```python
WORKFLOW (follow in order):
PHASE 1 - GATHER CONTEXT (Iteration 1):
1. Call check_calendar
2. Call get_meal_history|7
3. Call get_user_preferences

PHASE 2 - FETCH DISHES (Iteration 2-3):
4. Call get_dishes_by_meal_type|[meal_type]
5. Call get_side_dishes
...
```

**Problems**:
- Rigid workflow
- LLM had no freedom
- Unnecessary steps
- Hardcoded dishes

### NEW Approach ‚úÖ
```python
YOU DECIDE:
- Which tools to call and in what order
- How many tools you need
- When you have enough information
- When to call generate_final_menu
- When to provide FINAL_ANSWER

GUIDELINES (not strict rules):
- check_calendar: Useful for context
- get_meal_history: Helps avoid repetition
- get_user_preferences: Gets preferences
- generate_final_menu: Creates the menu (KEY TOOL)

YOU DECIDE what's appropriate based on the user's query!
```

**Benefits**:
- LLM has full autonomy
- Can be efficient (3 steps) or thorough (5 steps)
- Adapts to query complexity
- No unnecessary tool calls

## Example Workflows

### Simple Query: "suggest dinner"

**LLM decides (3 steps)**:
```
1. FUNCTION_CALL: get_user_preferences
   ‚Üí Gets taste/style preferences

2. FUNCTION_CALL: generate_final_menu|{"meal_type":"dinner","preferences":{...}}
   ‚Üí LLM generates complete menu

3. FINAL_ANSWER: [complete menu from tool]
   ‚Üí Done!
```

### Complex Query: "suggest something for dinner which can be cooked quickly and I had dal yesterday"

**LLM decides (5 steps)**:
```
1. FUNCTION_CALL: check_calendar
   ‚Üí Gets current day

2. FUNCTION_CALL: get_meal_history|7
   ‚Üí Sees dal was eaten yesterday

3. FUNCTION_CALL: get_user_preferences
   ‚Üí Gets preferences

4. FUNCTION_CALL: generate_final_menu|{"meal_type":"dinner","time_available":"quick","recent_meals":[...],"preferences":{...}}
   ‚Üí LLM generates menu avoiding dal, quick cooking

5. FINAL_ANSWER: [complete menu]
   ‚Üí Done!
```

## generate_final_menu - The Key Tool

This tool is where the magic happens:

```python
@mcp.tool()
def generate_final_menu(context_json: str) -> dict:
    """Generate complete North Indian food menu using LLM"""
    
    context = json.loads(context_json)
    
    # Initialize Gemini
    model = genai.GenerativeModel('gemini-2.0-flash-exp')
    
    prompt = f"""You are an expert North Indian food menu planner.

CONTEXT:
{json.dumps(context, indent=2)}

Create a complete North Indian menu that:
1. Matches the meal type
2. Respects time constraints
3. Considers user preferences
4. Avoids recent meals
5. Is practical for home cooking

NORTH INDIAN CUISINE KNOWLEDGE:
- Breakfast: Paratha, Poha, Upma, Idli, Dosa...
- Lunch/Dinner: Dal, Sabzi, Paneer dishes, Rajma...
- Sides: Roti, Naan, Rice, Raita...
- Snacks: Samosa, Pakora, Chaat...
- Beverages: Chai, Lassi, Buttermilk...

FORMAT:
üçΩÔ∏è [MEAL_TYPE] MENU

üçõ Main Dishes:
‚Ä¢ [Dish] - [Description] ([Time] min, [Difficulty])
  Ingredients: [Key ingredients]

ü•ó Side Dishes:
‚Ä¢ [Dish] - [Description] ([Time] min, [Difficulty])

‚òï Beverage:
‚Ä¢ [Beverage] - [Description] ([Time] min)

‚è±Ô∏è Total Time: [X] minutes
üë• Serves: [N] people

üí° Chef's Note:
[Why these dishes work together]"""

    response = model.generate_content(prompt)
    
    return {
        "success": True,
        "menu": response.text,
        "generated_by": "gemini-2.0-flash-exp"
    }
```

**Key Points**:
- Takes ALL context (preferences, constraints, history)
- Uses Gemini's knowledge of North Indian cuisine
- Generates specific dish names, not generic
- Includes descriptions, times, ingredients
- Adds chef's notes for context
- **NO hardcoded dishes anywhere**

## Benefits of New Architecture

### 1. Simplicity
- 5 tools instead of 11
- No hardcoded dish databases
- Clean, minimal code

### 2. Flexibility
- LLM decides workflow
- Adapts to query complexity
- Can be efficient or thorough

### 3. Intelligence
- LLM uses its knowledge of North Indian cuisine
- Creates contextually appropriate menus
- Considers all constraints

### 4. Maintainability
- No dish databases to maintain
- No workflow rules to update
- Just improve the prompt

### 5. Scalability
- Easy to add new cuisines (just update prompt)
- Easy to add new constraints
- No code changes needed
